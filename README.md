# Metro Navigation System

The **Metro Navigation System** is a Java terminal-based application designed to provide efficient navigation within a metro system. It is organized into four packages: `metroSystem`, `functionality`, `maps`, and `utility`, each serving a specific purpose to enhance the overall functionality and organization of the system.

## Functionality Package

This package encapsulates the core functionality of the metro navigation system through two essential classes:

### MetroStation Class
This class holds crucial information about a metro station, including its name, connected stations, distances to these stations, and corresponding metro lines.

### MetroMap Class
Responsible for orchestrating the metro system's functionality, this class features methods such as:

- `createStation`: Adds a new station to the metro map.
- `createPath`: Establishes a path between two stations, creating new stations if necessary.
- `getLineInfo`: Retrieves information about metro lines.
- `pathInfo`: Determines junctions and lines in the shortest path, displaying a structured and informative string.
- `path` (with method overriding): Finds the shortest path between two stations.
- `findShortestDistance`: Computes the shortest distance between two stations.

The `createPath` method, when invoked, creates a path between two stations. If the stations already exist, it establishes a path; otherwise, it creates new stations before forming the path. The `setPlatform` method assigns platform numbers to stations, with the `pathInfo` method considering this information.

## Maps Package

The `maps` package incorporates various classes representing maps of different cities. These classes leverage constructors and a group of `createPath` methods to define the metro network. After creating paths, the `setPlatforms` method is called to initialize platform numbers.

## Utility Package

The utility package contains two classes:

### Lodash Class
Used for string formatting, it converts strings into camel case, replacing spaces with hyphens. It includes methods `toLodash` for converting an unformatted string to a lodash string and `toNormal` for reversing the process.

### DispStat Class
Responsible for printing all stations in alphabetical order. Stations starting with 'A' are printed on one line, those starting with 'B' on another, and so forth.

## MetroSystem Package

The `metroSystem` package houses the main class, `Initiator`. This class performs the following tasks:

- Instantiates objects for all metro maps.
- Allows the user to select a specific metro map.
- Facilitates user selection of source and destination stations.
- Prints the most efficient route based on the selected metro map.
